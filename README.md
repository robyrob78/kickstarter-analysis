# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze Kickstarter data in order to help our client, Louise, get a better understanding of why some Kickstarter campaigns are successful, and why others fail. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
One of our main areas of focus when analyizing the data was to look at the successs rate based on the time of year the campaign was created. Once we narrowed the data field to focus on only theater productions, we were able to take that data and get a visual representation of success rates based on time of year. [this chart](https://github.com/robyrob78/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) shows all of our data visualized based on success or failure and the time of year these campaigns were launched. As we can see from the chart the months of May, June, and July were cleary the most successful times to launch a campaign.
