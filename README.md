# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze Kickstarter data in order to help our client, Louise, get a better understanding of why some Kickstarter campaigns are successful, and why others fail. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
One of our main areas of focus when analyizing the data was to look at the successs rate based on the time of year the campaign was created. Once we narrowed the data field to focus on only theater productions, we were able to take that data and get a visual representation of success rates based on time of year. [this chart](https://github.com/robyrob78/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) shows all of our data visualized based on success or failure and the time of year these campaigns were launched. As we can see from the chart the months of May, June, and July were cleary the most successful times to launch a campaign. While this data is helpful we also looked at another factor, the goal ammount of the campaign. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The next variable we took into consideration when analyzing this data was the goal, or the ammount of money the original author of the campaing was asking for. We again had to narrow our data field to focus only on theater productions. Once we had that data, we were able to generate [this chart](https://github.com/robyrob78/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) which shows the percentage of campaigns that were successful based on how much money they asked for. Unsurprisingly, the chart shows a general trend that campaigns were less successful the higher their goal was. From the chart we can see that the campaigns that had the most success, set their goal at $4,999 or less. *It is worth noting there is a spike in success in the ranges between $35,0000 and $44,999, however, there were only 9 projects in this range while the other generally successful areas had hundreds of projects. That is to say that although it might appear based on the graph that asking between $35,0000 and $44,999 was fairly successful, we didn't really have enough data in this range to say with any certainty that would be the general success rate. In fact our more statistically significant data points to the contrary that the higher the goal ammount, the less successful the project.*
